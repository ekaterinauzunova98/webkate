		<h1>Why I chose Barcelona and CARNET?</h1>
		<h4>Posted by Lisa, 2018</h4>
		<p>I chose to do my internship in Barcelona, because during my visit in 2017, I immediately fell in love with the city.</p>
		<p>I chose CARNET, because we also visited the company in 2017 and I was impressed by the activities they do to improve urban mobility and create a world where technology and people develop together.</p>
